// Implement the upper and lower half of the device driver code for the zero device here

// alwasy returns the requested number of bytes, but each byte is 0 (i.e. the bits are all 0s)








// Implement the upper and lower half of the device driver code for the random device here 
// The random device is an infinite stream of random bytes. Any read of the device for any number of bytes 
// alwasy returns the requested number of bytes, but each byte is a random value. Use the rand() and srand()
// functions from the xeroslib. The srand() function can be used to set a seed value for the rand() function
